<p>Following is a list of books I am reading currently.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_in_the_Woods_(book)">A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail</a></p>

<p>The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest hiking trails in the world, extending about 3,500 km across 14 states in United States. This book follows Bill Bryson's experiences as he hikes the trail with his friend. I have currently read till the first part of this book, with Bill and his friend realizing that they will never be able to hike the entire trail, but still deciding to hike as much as they can by skipping certain parts of the stretch. Still he hiked around 800 km in the first part, which is impressive.</p>
<p>I really should try something like this. Hiking is one of the comfort bubbles I am yet to pop open. What scares me though is not the hiking part. It's the shitting.</p>
<p>Keeping all the wonders of the Appalachian Trail aside, this was the question which nagged me the most. So how does he do it? I assume we have to dig a small hole in the ground, do the deed and clean up. What do we use to clean up? Toilet paper? Water? Big leaves? I usually have to go around three times a day. Do I dig holes everytime? Will I be able to find private spots three times a day?</p>
<p>I swear, this is the only thing stopping me from trying hiking. I'm confident about my physical ability. Atleast I'm sure that I can train myself for hiking. But this. Shitting in the open. This scares me!</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Peanuts">The Complete Peanuts</a></p>
<p>Peanuts is undoubtedly one of the greatest comic strips ever written. I still remember reading the &quot;Two ponies&quot; strip a long time back.</p>
