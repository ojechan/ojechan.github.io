<p>Why this site?</p>
<p>Recently, I deleted my social media accounts. By &quot;all&quot;, I mean just Facebook. It was so liberating! Turns out I was using Facebook mainly to peep at what other people were doing, and to get angry about the political situation in my country. The price I was paying for that was huge. How huge? Just raise an export for your personal data in Facebook. You'll see what I am talking about. Facebook has way more information than they should have about each and every one of us. Same goes with Google, Amazon, and all the big tech companies I don't have to name specifically.</p>
<p>So how big of an impact is it when a handful of people decide to quit Facebook? Not much obviously. But still, I urge anybody reading this to try it out. You'll hopefully understand how unnecessary Facebook is in your life. Unless of course you're a big social media &quot;influencer&quot; who uses Facebook to live. In that case, I feel you are weirder than Facebook.</p>
<p>Now that I have quit pretty much all major social networks, how would people find me if they wanted to? That thought has led me to this site. I have also exposed one email address to contact me. I know, so old-school right?</p>
<p>I honestly don't know if this will lead to anything. Let's say I am curious. Will a random stranger email me? Will the person be nice? I guess only time will tell. If you, reader, are considering to be that stranger, please be nice! That is one thing I have learned over the years. The world will be a much better place to live in if everybody just took some effort to be nice to each other. Sounds so hippie when I say it, but it's true!</p>
