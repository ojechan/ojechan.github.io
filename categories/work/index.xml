You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be productive day in and day out. Learn to have fun, doing interesting things, and productivity will naturally follow. There will be days when you lounge around and do nothing, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine!
In other words, take a f-ing breath. Remember that fun is not always productive.
DON&amp;rsquo;T TRY THIS AT WORK!</description></item></channel></rss>
