You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be productive day in and day out. Learn to have fun, doing interesting things, and productivity will naturally follow. There will be days when you lounge around and do nothing, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine!
In other words, take a f-ing breath. Remember that fun is not always productive.
DON&amp;rsquo;T TRY THIS AT WORK!</description></item><item><title>Protocol for (my) death</title><link>https://jishnunair.net/posts/protocol-for-death/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:22:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://jishnunair.net/posts/protocol-for-death/</guid><description>This is a letter to the people who hold me dear, if faced with my death. I am writing this in November, 2021. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when I will die. Hopefully, it may not be too soon. What if I do end up dying soon? That is what I am trying to address here. A protocol for my own death.
tldr: I am dead. Move on as fast as you can.</description></item></channel></rss>
