<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    This is not a resume, so I can be who I am. 
    <br>
    I do not want to start with "<i>Experienced professional with 
    over 8 years of experience ..</i>". 
</p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
    I don't really know. Nobody really knows who they are. 
</p>
<p>
    Society in general chooses profession or academic position to define people. 
    "<i>I am X, and I do this. I study this. That is the entirety of who I am.</i>". <br>
</p>
<p>
    I'm just gonna go with "<i>I do not know. But you're welcome to find out!</i>"
</p>
<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>
    Again I do not want to start with my profession. Let me start with my interests.
</p>
<p>
    My interests vary over time, generally revolving around reading and music. I read 
    whatever I can get my hands on. Fiction, non-fiction, manga, magazines, doesn't matter 
    what the topic is. I just feel like I have to imbibe everything.
</p>
<p>
    I also consume a lot of movies, anime, and music. There's just so much to encapsulate in words.
    Let me just say, nothing mainstream. Nothing commodified for viewer groups. I seek true 
    passion. I seek to witness the will of the creator, eat the fruit of actual thought! 
</p>
<p>
    Consuming content is not my only interest in life. I love the process of creation. 
    Right now my creations are in the form of words, and they are amateuristic. I hope that one day, 
    my creations take the center stage. I hope that I will succeed in creating something which transcends my identity. That would be a life well lived.
</p>
<p>
    Now for professional work. I currently work at Dell Technologies, in the analytics team 
    supporting sales. My work typically involves automating sales reports primarily using Python. 
    This involves a lot of browser automation, databases, automated emails and report generation. 
    Previously I have worked in various ETL tools, creating data pipelines for almost all the major 
    relational databases. I have also worked in creating real time B2B EDI interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    I am also trained and certified in data science and analytics. My primary work experience is 
    in Data Engineering, and I seek to explore more avenues in Data Engineering in my next roles.  
</p>
<p>
    I love having problems to solve, and the kick of engineering solutions keeps me going.  
    I love learning new things, and I don't want to stop learning ever!
