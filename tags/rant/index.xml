Especially those big airports with lots of empty seats and a multitude of shops around. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in one of the airports he was talking about, and I don&amp;rsquo;t share his admiration.
Who likes airports? Who does not? To start with, at least for Indian airports, only the international terminals are going to fit this category. That too, probably the airports in major cities.</description></item></channel></rss>
