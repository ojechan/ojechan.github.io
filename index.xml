        <description>The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest hiking trails in the world, extending about 3,500 km across 14 states in the United States. This book follows Bill Bryson&amp;rsquo;s experiences as he hikes the trail with his friend. I have currently read the first part of this book, with Bill and his friend realizing that they will never be able to hike the entire trail, but still deciding to hike as much as they can by skipping certain parts of the stretch.</description>

        <description>Who am I? I don&amp;rsquo;t really know. Nobody really knows who they are.
Society in general chooses profession or academic position to define people. &amp;ldquo;I am X, and I do this. I study this. That is the entirety of who I am.&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna go with &amp;ldquo;I do not know. But you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to find out!&amp;rdquo;
What do I do? Again I do not want to start with my profession.</description>
